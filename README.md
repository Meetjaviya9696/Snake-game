# Snake's Game


Snake's Game is a Python implementation of the classic Snake game using the Turtle graphics library. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food pellets to grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the screen.

## Features

- Snake Movement:
Control the snake's movement using arrow keys or WASD keys.
- Food Generation:
 Food pellets are randomly generated on the screen for the snake to eat.
- Scoring:
 Keep track of your score as you eat food pellets.
- Collision Detection:
    - Detect collision with food:
        When the snake's head touches a food pellet, it eats the food, grows longer, and scores points.
    - Detect collision with walls:
        If the snake hits the boundaries of the screen, the game resets, and the score is reset to zero.
    - Detect collision with the snake's own tail:
        If the snake collides with itself, the game resets, and the score is reset to zero.
- Game Over Screen:
 The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the screen.
